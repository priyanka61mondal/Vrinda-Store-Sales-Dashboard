# Vrinda-Store-Sales-Report-2022-Data-Analysis

Hello connections,
I am sharing my first data analysis project with the help of MS Excel. I have picked the dataset from the youtube channel “Rishabh Mishra” .

Objective:
Vrinda Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022, so that the store can understand their marketing strategy and grow more sales in 2023.

Questions asked:
1. Compare the sales and orders using single chart and also find the month that has got the highest sales and orders.
2. Who purchased more in 2022, men or women?
3. What are the different order status in 2022?
4. What are the top 5 states that contributed to maximum sales?
5. Show the relation between Age and gender based on the number of orders?
6. Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

Analysis:
· At first I understood the data and found the business problems.
· I did data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values and made an Age group column from Age column using IF function.
· Created PivotTable to summarize the data and create charts and graphs to solve the business problems.
· Lastly , I have built a dashboard in excel with slicers so that users can interact with the dashboard and view it in different ways to get results.

Key insights:
1. March month recorded the highest sales and orders.
2. Women purchased more than men (64%)
3. Maximum order status was seen to be delivered (92%)
4. Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu are the top 5 states by highest sales.
5. Women of the Adult age group were the highest to place orders (35%)
6. Amazon (35%), Myntra (23%)  and Flipkart (22%) channels are contributing to maximum sales

Final conclusion to improve the sales :
The store must target more Women customers of the Adult age group living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu by giving more discounts, offers and coupons and gifts above a particular purchase amount available on Amazon, Myntra and Flipkart.

Special Thanks to Rishabh Mishra sir for the session.
